# Storm-Tutorial
This is a tutorial project for Apache Storm, to help people new to Storm, Streaming
and Kafka get up to speed faster.

The goal here is to create a simple Kafka Producer app (in Python) that then triggers
a Storm stream to process it.  The streaming example is incredibly simple, but the
project is about workflow, not what the actual processor does (at least, not right now)
